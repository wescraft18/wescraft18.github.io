				<ul>

					<li>
						
						<h4><a href="http://www.imdb.com/">IMDb</a></h4>
						
						<p>This website allows me read up on all of the latest news about the movies I've already seen, or am wanting to watch.</p>

						<p>The hompage has information about what is in the box office, what is opening this week, with links to news, blogs, etc.  My eyes are drawn to the upper portion of the page, containing the search bar.  Probably because the background is dark and the search bar is light colored.  Using this feature I can easily navigate and find what I am looking for.</p>

						<p>Navigating around the content of imdb is easy to do.  An example is clicking the actors name in one movie brings up their profile, allowing users to find other films they have starred in.</p>

					</li>

					<li>
						
						<h4><a href="http://www.engadget.com/">engadget</a></p>
						
						<p>Another favorite of mine is engadget.  Which provides news and updates about cutting edge technologies.</p>

						<p>The homepage draws your attention towards a bundle of pictures, which link to popular articles lower on the page.  If you want to know what news is trending there is a nice sidebar that links to and details which is being shared the most.</p>

						<p>User navigation is easy as the top nav bar moves as the user scrolls.  If you have never checked this site out, I recommend giving it a look.</p>

					</li>

					<li>

						<h4><a href="http://thechive.com/">theChive</a><h4>

						<p>I have saved the best for last.  The chive is set up like a blogging site. Which draws your attention to a brightly colored content section containing picture and gif threads...a few videos sprinkled about.  The real gem of this website is the community of users this website connects...a great group of giving individuals.</p>

						<p> Getting around this site is very straight forward.  As the user is able to open threads of pictures to scroll.  The site also adds a slideshow picture navigation...never got into that.  I don't like that the navigation bar at the top is static and doesn't follow you as you scroll.  That aside, awesome site check this one out.</p>
